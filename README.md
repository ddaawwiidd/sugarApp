# sugarApp

<h4>Who</h4>

On 4 of March 2015 WHO announced:
<i> "A new WHO guideline recommends adults and children reduce their daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake. A further reduction to below 5% or roughly 25 grams (6 teaspoons) per day would provide additional health benefits."</i></br>
I love free sugar (sweets) and I have problem with controling my desire. So, I decided to do something about it and since I’m learning to program, I thought that could be interesting training project. 

<h4>What</h4>

<strong>Here it is ... “sugarApp”.</strong> 

<strong>sugarApp</strong> is very simple. </br>
1.	You put how much grams of sugar you have eaten,</br>
2.	And you press <strong>Add</strong> button to save it.</br>

Depending on your sugar consumption level <strong>sugarApp</strong> will cheer you or nag you.   
When the new day starts, you press <strong>New day</strong> button and your count start from zero again.

<h4>Why</h4>

Why I even bothered to do <strong>sugarApp</strong>?

I like the idea of quantifying my health but I have big problem with all the apps available on the market. They collect too much data about me and I have no time to read their privacy statements to figure out what they want to do with all the information. 
That’s why <strong>sugarApp</strong> is very light. All the data is saved in local storage on your computer/smartphone and is deleted the moment you press <strong>New day</strong> button.

<h4>When</h4>

There is no saving history of your sugar consumption. I believe that <strong>changing habit depends on NOW</strong>. And that’s why the only aim of <strong>sugarApp</strong> is to delay your next bite.

<h2>Enjoy. It is free and private.</h2>
